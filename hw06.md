5. cpu:  
A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic  
 circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions  
  of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic,   
  logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified   
   by the instructions. The computer industry has used the   
   term "central processing unit" at least since the early   
   1960s.[1] Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers to a   
   processor, more specifically to its processing unit and   
   control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a   
   computer from external components such as main memory and   
   I/O circuitry.  
ram:  
Random-access memory is a form of computer data storage   
that stores data and machine code currently being used. A   
random-access memory device allows data items to be read or   
written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the   
physical location of data inside the memory. In contrast, with   
other direct-access data storage media such as hard disks,   
CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and the older magnetic tapes and drum memory,   
the time required to read and write data items varies   
significantly depending on their physical locations on the   
recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media   
rotation speeds and arm movement.  
rom:  
Read-only memory (ROM) is a type of non-volatile memory   
used in computers and other electronic devices. Data stored in   
ROM can only be modified slowly, with difficulty, or not at   
all, so it is mainly used to store firmware (software that is   
closely tied to specific hardware, and unlikely to need   
frequent updates) or application software in plug-in   
cartridges.   
Bus (computing):  
In computer architecture, a bus (a contraction of the Latin   
omnibus) is a communication system that transfers data between   
components inside a computer, or between computers. This   
expression covers all related hardware components (wire,   
optical fiber, etc.) and software, including communication   
protocols.  
Parallel Computing:  
Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many   
calculations or the execution of processes are carried out   
simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into   
smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There   
are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level,   
instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has  
long been employed in high-performance computing, but it's   
gaining broader interest due to the physical constraints   
preventing frequency scaling. As power consumption (and   
consequently heat generation) by computers has become a   
concern in recent years, parallel computing has become the   
dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form   
of multi-core processors.  
6. 云计算：  
狭义云计算是指IT基础设施的交付和使用模式，指通过网络以按需、易扩展的  
方式获得所需的资源；广义云计算是指服务的交付和使用模式，指通过网络以  
按需、易扩展的方式获得所需的服务。这种服务可以是IT和软件、互联网相关 
的，也可以是任意其他的服务，它具有超大规模、虚拟化、可靠安全等独特功效。  
云计算的核心思想，是将大量用网络连接的计算资源统一管理和调度，构成一  
个计算资源池向用户按需服务。
